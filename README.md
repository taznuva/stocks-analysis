# Stocks-Analysis_VBA_Challenge


## Overview of Project

In this project, we're refactoring the code we made for Steve from the module. The whole point of refactoring code is to make it neater, less convoluted, and more efficient such as faster run-time. In this case, we're refactoring code from the previous dataset to expand the dataset so Steve can see the entire stock market. Applying the knowledge gained from the module and practice from previous code, we'll be comparing the runtimes between the original code and the refactored one. 

## Results


## Summary

1)What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Advantages - neater, comprehension is improved for a different user or coming back to code after a long time, less memory required, faster run-time. 
Disadvantages - may take more time to edit, possible more debugging with initializing arrays in 'for' loops. May not always work out. 

2)How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Although I've been able to compress the original code from running multiple macros into a single one, I feel it took more time editing to fewer steps compared to original.
